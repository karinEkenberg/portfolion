  <p>
    Hi, I'm Karin Ekenberg, a passionate web developer currently pursuing a
    diploma in web development at TUC Yrkeshögskola. I specialize in creating
    user-friendly, responsive, and modern web designs with a strong focus on
    clean code and intuitive interfaces. <br />
    <br />

    With hands-on experience in React, TypeScript, and .NET MVC, I thrive in
    collaborative environments that use agile methodologies like Scrum. My
    projects include designing and developing a website for a football
    association, where I utilized tools such as Figma, TailwindCSS, and API
    integration. For my upcoming thesis project, I will focus on building a web
    application using .NET MVC, incorporating interactive elements to create an
    engaging user experience. <br />
    <br />

    I am constantly learning and eager to embrace new technologies and
    challenges. Whether it's solving complex problems, refining user
    experiences, or bringing creative ideas to life, I’m dedicated to making a
    meaningful impact through my work.
