      Hi, I'm Karin Ekenberg, a passionate web developer currently pursuing a
      diploma in web development at TUC Yrkesh√∂gskola. I specialize in creating
      user-friendly, responsive, and modern web designs with a strong focus on
      clean code and intuitive interfaces. <br />
      <br />

      With hands-on experience in React, TypeScript, and .NET MVC, I thrive in
      collaborative environments that use agile methodologies like Scrum. My
      projects include designing and developing a website for a football
      association, where I utilized tools such as Figma, TailwindCSS, and API
      integration. For my upcoming thesis project, I will focus on building a
      web application using .NET MVC, incorporating interactive elements to
      create an engaging user experience. <br />
      <br />

      I am constantly learning and eager to embrace new technologies and
      challenges. Whether it's solving complex problems, refining user
      experiences, or bringing creative ideas to life, I'm dedicated to making a
      meaningful impact through my work.
